# RbCue2Txt

Parses cue files from Rekordbox's recordings to produce readable, markdown-friendly playlists.

I needed a similar utility, I've seen there are many of them out there, but I wanted to make a more portable one while playing with Rust.

## Usage

```sh
rbcue2txt <path to cue file>
```

By default, it will output the playlist in this format:

```
- [00:00:02] Giuseppe Surace - Shot You Down (Original Mix)
- [00:03:06] Aldo Cadiz - Tzu-Mani
...
- [00:57:02] Super Flu - Super Flu 3 < Isaac
```

And in markdown it would look like this:

- [00:00:02] Giuseppe Surace - Shot You Down (Original Mix)
- [00:03:06] Aldo Cadiz - Tzu-Mani
...
- [00:57:02] Super Flu - Super Flu 3 < Isaac


However, you can also pass a desired output format as second argument, by following these rules:

- `%A`: artist name
- `%T`: time
- `%N`: title

So, for example, calling `rbcue2txt <path to cue file> "%A - %N"` will produce this output:

```
Giuseppe Surace - Shot You Down (Original Mix)
Aldo Cadiz - Tzu-Mani
...
Super Flu - Super Flu 3 < Isaac
```
